# Classification-on-Rain-in-Australia
Dataset imported from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package


For this project, I have chosen “Rain in Australia” dataset which is found in Kaggle.com. 
It contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia. 
The goal of this project is to predict if it rains next day. There might be two values, 
1 (True) and 0(False) which means it rains and not rains next day.
